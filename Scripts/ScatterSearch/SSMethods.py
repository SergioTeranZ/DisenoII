#	solutions are typically feasible. If the input trial solution is not improved as a result 
#	of the apá¹•lication of this method, the "enhanced" solution is considered to be the same as

# 	to build and maintain a reference set consisting of the b "best" solutions found 
#	(where the value of b is typically small, e.g., no more than 20), organixed to provide 
#	efficient accessing by other parts of the solution procedure. Several alternative criteria

# 	SubSet Generation Method
# 	to operate on the reference set, to produce a subset of its solutions as a basis for 
#	creating combined solutions, The most common subset generation method is to generate all
